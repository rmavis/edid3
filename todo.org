* TODO
- It isn't necessary for the ID3 tag to occur at the beginning of the file -- they can also occur at the end, or presumably anywhere else.
- What about pulling/scanning for a tag from the end of the file? A tag with a footer must appear at the end of a file.
- In `readBytes`
- In `v24GetFrames`
- What about being a little more fault-tolerant? Would that involve a lot of work? I'm slightly concerned
  about the position of the reader and the contents of the file. The reader relies on the contents of the file being in the right/required/specified place, assuming all is as specified in the spec. What if there are extraneous bytes? What if the `size` value in the header is wrong?
